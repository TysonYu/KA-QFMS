', 'industrial designer: um ', 'user interface: but i kind of uh ', \"industrial designer: i do n't think so , \", 'project manager: okay . yeah , okay . ', 'industrial designer: because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , ', 'user interface: yes . uh ', 'project manager: okay .

', \"project manager: yeah ? well , what that 's what you want trying to say . \", 'user interface: well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . ', 'project manager: okay . okay . ', \"user interface: but i do n't know . it 's it 's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use . \", 'project manager: yeah , well some of these uh , yeah . well , some of that will yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements . ', 'user interface: yeah , probably , yeah . ', 'marketing: yes . ', 'project manager: so ', \"user interface: uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . i think that 's just basic what we need . \", 'project manager: mm-hmm . ', \"user interface: and from that on we can user requirements what we need more . uh yeah , i just um um i thought joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and i do n't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it 's com becoming less trendy or something like that . \", 'marketing: yes . ', 'user interface: m you can just you can k ', \"marketing: i have n't really found a conclusion like that . \", 'user interface: you can keep it in mind that . ', 'marketing: yeah . ', \"user interface: i do n't know . uh , i th i thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh \", 'marketing: design . ', 'user interface: yeah , more trendier design , i think . i think . ', 'marketing: sounds interesting . ', 'project manager: ', 'user interface: yeah ? ', 'marketing: ', \"user interface: uh , well , that 's all i have to say , i think . \", 'project manager: okay . ', 'user interface: yeah , that was it . ', 'marketing: alright . ', 'project manager: well , then the marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market . ', 'marketing: yes . ', 'user interface: . ', \"marketing: yeah . it 's alright . um alright , i 've done some research for functional requirements . um yes . the working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . uh , i 've lined them up here . uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . i uh have found some interesting things . we do we do got a market . um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . so if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as i uh quoted here from the uh results . zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . that 's quite a lot . um , relevant options are , of course , power buttons . although , only used once per hour . uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . that does n't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . but it sure um says we should n't make it too uh complicated . fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . and um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . and uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . so , what i was thinking oh , wrong side . we should n't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . group features for a higher usability , uh what i was claiming in the previous meeting . um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . \", 'project manager: okay . ', \"marketing: and um , if you want to implement v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ options , group them in the button , not too uh yeah . small buttons , so they wo n't be very um , how do you say \", 'project manager: visually presents . ', \"marketing: yes , wo n't be very present , thank you . and a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who do n't really care for trendy looks or whatever , i guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . that was kind of what i found . \", 'project manager: okay . ', 'user interface: okay . ', 'marketing: okay . ', \"project manager: well , then we i 'm gon na show you some of the new project requirements and then we gon na discuss on uh what features we find important . \", 'marketing: yes . ', 'project manager: uh , well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , i think . ', 'marketing: ', 'project manager: because um uh s decided to put they have decide to put two additional requirements forward . well , now i see four . ', 'marketing: two ? ', \"project manager: that 's kinda strange . well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . well , i think that may be so , but well , we ca n't just leave the teletext button off . \", 'user interface: well ', \"project manager: it 's impossible , i think . \", 'user interface: no way . ', 'marketing: no uh , i agree , i agree . ', \"project manager: so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and do n't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or \", 'marketing: not too much , no . ', \"project manager: you know , it 's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . \", 'marketing: yeah . ', 'project manager: so we have to think of that . the remote control should only be used for television . otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . so maybe we should leave all d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ related features off completely . ', 'user interface: yeah . ', 'marketing: okay . ', \"project manager: i do n't know . i think that uh that 's what they 're trying to say . \", 'marketing: ', 'project manager: uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . new products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . so you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . ', 'marketing: mm-hmm . ', \"project manager: but , well , they 're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger \", \"marketing: i do n't really agree actually , to be honest . it 's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . it 's only like thirty percent of the total market . \", \"project manager: yeah , but it is it 's is a dif it 's a fact that the th th that bigger market you 're talking about , we already cover that . \", 'marketing: mayb yeah ? ', \"project manager: our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . that 's the one we have n't covered yet . so i think that 's what the problem is . we have n't got remote controls for uh \", 'marketing: okay . ', 'project manager: well i think , yeah . ', 'marketing: maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . ', \"project manager: yeah , i think so . maybe if it 's \", 'marketing: not too much then , bu alright . ', \"project manager: no no , but i think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . so maybe we can make a remote control that 's primarily interesting for the younger group , but is n't that bad for an older person either . \", 'marketing: yes . ', \"project manager: uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . our product 's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . okay , something else nice to know . \", \"user interface: but what 's our slogan ? \", 'project manager: sorry ? yeah , you will have to look that up . ', 'user interface: the slogan uh ', \"marketing: yeah , i 'll have a look . \", \"project manager: i think it 's something about the \", 'user interface: puts fashion in electronics . ', 'marketing: we put the fashion in electronics . ', \"project manager: oh , okay . i thought it w might be , let 's make things better or something , but \", 'user interface: sense simplicity . ', 'marketing: sense and simplicity . ', \"project manager: okay well , let 's go back to the the agenda . so we 've now had to the three presentations . we know about the new project requirements . that means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . well , if i can uh make a start , i think it 's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it 's gon na be , and i already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . i think we 're we 're looking for some \", 'marketing: ', \"project manager: yeah , we we 're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic tv functions . y well , that \", 'user interface: yeah . ', \"marketing: well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that 's not very uh yeah , we do n't really need to have a simple remote control . \", 'project manager: yeah . yeah . ', 'marketing: i think we can implement more functions then , because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology ', 'user interface: yeah , but wha ', 'project manager: yeah , yeah . ', 'marketing: and therefore will be a more ', \"project manager: m yeah , that 's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , i think they are are c are contradicting each other , \", 'user interface: but ', 'project manager: because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just tv , but they s do aim at a younger ', 'marketing: yes . ', 'project manager: well , ma ', \"user interface: yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions are n't used . \", 'marketing: yeah . ', 'user interface: so why should j we put this function in ? ', 'marketing: well , i think ', 'user interface: i think more i think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions . ', 'industrial designer: ', 'project manager: but i think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have y well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t tv and a d_v_d_ player . ', 'marketing: yes . ', \"project manager: you can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the tv set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . we do n't want that . i think that was that became clear . we do n't want . but w maybe we should put some func uh , i know that the younger people will most likely have a d_v_d_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh \", 'marketing: yeah , control . ', 'user interface: yeah , but uh you said ', 'project manager: control , remotely . ', \"user interface: yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we 're making . \", 'marketing: ', 'project manager: no , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the the new project requirements told us not to ', \"user interface: it 's n yeah . \", 'project manager: but maybe w yeah . i think we maybe should ', 'user interface: yeah . ', 'project manager: yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . but just the basic functions . maybe like rewind and wind , ', 'marketing: ', 'project manager: or n what d what do you guys think ? ', 'industrial designer: but you can put them under the same button . ', 'marketing: not much more than that . ', 'project manager: yeah , if as far as possible . ', \"marketing: yep . or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . \", 'project manager: but what do you think ? ', 'marketing: so t ', 'project manager: do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ? ', 'user interface: no . ', \"project manager: no , you do n't think so ? \", 'marketing: ', 'user interface: no , new requirements say no . ', 'project manager: yeah , the new requirements say so . ', 'user interface: so ', 'industrial designer: but you can put a play and stop and and rewind . ', \"project manager: well , maybe it 's \", 'marketing: yeah . ', \"project manager: maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions do n't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . \", 'user interface: yeah , but ', 'project manager: you know , a lot of d_v_d_ players have some tricky settings with ', 'industrial designer: yes , but we ', \"user interface: i i if it 's too simple uh th they wo n't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions . \", 'marketing: y yes . ', \"project manager: yep , exactly . that 's that 's wha \", \"marketing: but but for for example , v_c_r_ , that 's better example in this case . i think on a remote control for television you do n't need to be able to programme uh the v_c_r_ to start recording at three p_m_ or whatever , \", \"project manager: no no , you do n't no no , you do n't need it . no , no . \", 'user interface: no , no . exactly . ', 'industrial designer: huh . ', 'marketing: just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward . ', 'project manager: okay , but we have to think uh w we have to think d_v_d_ i th uh , i guess , ', 'marketing: yeah , i know , but uh ', \"project manager: so um but uh from my experience it 's kinda a lot of d_v_d_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . it 's c sometimes a bit difficult . \", 'user interface: mm , yeah . ', 'project manager: maybe if we just leave the d_v_d_ functional m uh well , i was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , i think we m should focus on the tv then .

', 'marketing: yeah . ', 'user interface: yeah , nothing more . exactly . ', 'project manager: okay . ', 'marketing: alright . ', 'project manager: um , but what televis ', 'industrial designer: but how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? there are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have ', \"project manager: yeah , we we 'll make w this one trendy . \", 'user interface: yeah . ', 'industrial designer: ', 'project manager: and simple . ', 'user interface: the user interface is easy . ', 'project manager: well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . so we should put uh zap buttons on it . um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels . ', 'user interface: and the basic yeah , basic functions , yeah . ', 'marketing: yes , definitely , yeah . ', 'project manager: uh , ', \"user interface: it 's too much integrated in the other . \", 'project manager: okay , a t a teletext button should be there . but just one big teletext button , on and off . ', 'user interface: yeah . ', 'project manager: probably . ', 'marketing: yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . i think stop function is very useful . if you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , ', 'project manager: oh , okay . ', \"marketing: then i think it 's very irritating if the next page shows up , but \", \"project manager: yeah , but uh i think that becomes too difficult , it 's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . \", 'marketing: well , i use it very regularly , the action . i re i use it quite often .

', \"industrial designer: no , it 's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest . \", 'project manager: yep . ', 'user interface: maybe uh ', \"project manager: no , okay , but we do n't have to uh , when we do n't want to uh control other devices , i think it makes it even more simple . \", 'industrial designer: no . ', 'user interface: uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe . if you use large batteries or small batter batteries . ', 'project manager: i think ', 'industrial designer: the most standard batteries . ', 'project manager: i think that we should use uh d ', 'user interface: yeah ? ', 'marketing: i think double a_ . ', 'project manager: yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind ', 'marketing: yep . ', 'project manager: th the most uh well , it has to be simple , and i wi ', 'user interface: yeah . ', 'marketing: the most ordinary uh batteries .

', 'project manager: oh . how much time do we ha we have left uh ? m m m more than thirty minutes ? ', 'marketing: i think about twenty minutes . ', \"project manager: uh ten twenty minutes . well , uh these these should n't \", 'user interface: early break . ', 'industrial designer: but i in a way we have to be uh uh special . ', \"project manager: yeah . yeah , okay . but that 's that 's do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? how we can what the extra touch can be . do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or \", 'industrial designer: maybe th m ', 'project manager: well , it was something about how we lose them . maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing .

', \"marketing: yeah , yeah , that 's good one , yep . \", 'project manager: or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , ', 'user interface: yeah . ', \"project manager: or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener . maybe it contains some feature that you do n't normally link to a remote control . i think it 's very impor because we 're gon na make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . \", 'user interface: yeah . ', \"project manager: it 's gon na cost twenty five euros . \", 'marketing: ye i think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . ', \"project manager: yeah , but the well , it 's already been done . \", \"user interface: yeah , but that 's yeah . \", \"project manager: nah . yeah , that 's true . but and i think it 's gon na be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . \", 'marketing: yes . ', 'project manager: it has to be used something special , ', 'user interface: yeah . ', 'project manager: and you really it has to , ', 'marketing: yep .

', \"project manager: uh , also for you maybe , when t you it 's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . \", 'user interface: mm-hmm . and use friendly , yeah .

', 'user interface: must brain-storm . ', 'marketing: yeah , a swapable front or whatever .

', 'marketing: ', 'project manager: but it and i think we have to make it quite big . ', 'user interface: yeah . quite big . yeah , you think ? ', 'project manager: yeah , ', 'marketing: yes , definitely , definitely . ', 'project manager: people ', \"industrial designer: that 's to be uh a formed for your hand . \", \"project manager: so , and and also because uh it is expensive . if you want it to be something , you know , it 's ha does n't have much functions \", 'marketing: ', \"project manager: want to be you do n't want to get it l make it \", 'marketing: yes , it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . as i uh as i said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o ', 'project manager: mm-hmm . and shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . i i think you m might wan na put it uh ', 'user interface: a standard or something .

', 'user interface: ', 'industrial designer: more like a joystick then . ', 'marketing: yeah , yeah , i see what you mean , yep . ', \"user interface: it 's like you have uh four phones . something like that . \", 'project manager: yeah yeah , but yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in ', \"marketing: if you do that , but i do n't know if that 's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half euros . \", \"project manager: that it 's it 's fashionable . \", 'user interface: ', \"project manager: i i do n't \", 'marketing: i in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . ', 'project manager: oh , yeah . ', \"marketing: that 's probably stupid , but uh as i found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? \", \"industrial designer: but that 's that 's fun for the first time , and then the second \", 'marketing: uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control . ', 'project manager: yeah , but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it ', 'marketing: no uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . ', 'project manager: oh , okay . ', 'user interface: on the television . ', \"project manager: uh , that 's kind of nice . \", 'user interface: oh , like this . ', 'marketing: if an a button in in that uh ', 'user interface: ', \"project manager: and then also you do n't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . \", 'industrial designer: or you can ', 'user interface: a char chargeable . yeah . ', 'marketing: yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . why not . ', 'industrial designer: yeah . ', \"project manager: yeah , that w yeah , but yeah , the pro no , well i think that it might be t p well , nee but we do n't yeah . \", 'user interface: why not . ', \"project manager: maybe you , but we do n't know much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on a remote control and it 's a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units . \", 'industrial designer: with recharger . ', 'user interface: ', 'marketing: it should only cost twelve and a half euros , of course . aye ? ', \"project manager: yeah , but we would d ma we 'd do it in taiwan and so , it 's not gon na be that expen \", 'user interface: production . ', 'marketing: yeah , okay . ', \"project manager: uh i i think it 's a great idea . \", \"user interface: it should be possible . i think it 's a good idea . \", 'marketing: yeah . ', \"project manager: s some kind of be i 've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays . \", 'user interface: to make a base or something ? ', 'marketing: yes . yes , definitely . yeah . ', 'industrial designer: yes , but is that handy ? ', \"project manager: well , i well it 's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . that 's one . \", \"user interface: it 's it 's it 's it 's \", 'project manager: and uh you can always find your remote control up ', \"user interface: it 's not the purpose to be handy , it 's \", 'industrial designer: but but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries . ', \"project manager: uh , okay . well , maybe yeah , you could when that 's when it 's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , \", 'industrial designer: and then you ', 'project manager: but you will you do need uh also an uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . does it makes it kinda ', 'industrial designer: yes . or ', 'marketing: well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . ', \"user interface: mm . yeah , but that 's not it 's ugly , i think . \", 'project manager: yeah , yeah . okay . yeah . ', \"marketing: i do n't know . \", \"project manager: yeah , but then it 's very easy to make it also a rechargeab i do n't think that is gon na cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . \", 'user interface: no . ', \"marketing: on the other hand , if you do n't do it , we can also make a nice bay . i mean , it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it , \", 'project manager: yeah . ', 'marketing: but um i think the bay is definitely uh ', \"project manager: i think it 's a good idea . and make it , you know , we we um well , we uh it 's it is n't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . we can save on the on the functions . we just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there 's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , \", 'marketing: sure , why not . yep .

', \"project manager: yeah . and then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing . yeah . i think i think it 's a good idea . \", 'marketing: yeah .

', \"project manager: and the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . if that 's too expensive , we wo n't do that . \", 'user interface: yeah , we c ', 'project manager: but it would be nice . ', 'marketing: it would be nice , yes . ', \"project manager: it 's the idea . i know that batteries last long nowadays . and and what people just think about , well , i 'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it 's very annoying when your battery is empty . and you know then when you have n't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo i 've experienced that that \", 'marketing: most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes .

', 'industrial designer: but you pay for it . ', \"project manager: yeah , but it w i mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that 's a great idea , i 'm gon na use it . and when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , i 'll never put him in the recharger , i think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . then when they look get m i i i know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they 're seeking for the remote control , they wan na see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , \", 'user interface: yeah .
